These are the 3d model files that are used to print out the platform that's used for balancing. The model that has been printed uses 30% infill and has shown good performance in simulating PID control for a 2 DOF arm. More improvement will come.

Note:
1. The movement are a bit restricted due to parts being tight fit
2. Parts can be grinded down to ease movement but takes a lot of time
